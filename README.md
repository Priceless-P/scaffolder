# Scaffolder

Scaffolder is a command-line tool written in Python that helps developers create project structures quickly and easily. It supports generating project structures for web applications using various frameworks, including FastAPI, Flask, and Node.js/Express.js.

## Features

- Supports scaffolding projects for FastAPI, Flask, and Node.js/Express.js.
- Allows users to specify the type of project and the directory where the project structure should be generated.
- Follows industry standards for project structure and organization.
- Written in Python for ease of use and platform independence.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priceless-P/scaffolder.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd scaffolder
   ```

4. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```bash
   ./main.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to specify the type of project and the directory where the project structure should be generated.

6. Once the scaffolding process is complete, you will see a message indicating that the project scaffolding has been completed.

## Supported Project Types

- **FastAPI**: Scaffolds a project structure for building APIs with FastAPI.
- **Flask**: Scaffolds a project structure for building web applications with Flask.
- **Node.js/Express.js**: Scaffolds a project structure for building web applications with Node.js and Express.js.

## Project Structure
The generated project structure follows industry standards and is organized based on the chosen framework. Each scaffolded project includes the necessary directories and files to get started with development.
